🇺🇸 I'm a software developer currently working for [HUVRdata](https://www.huvrdata.com/) in Austin, Texas.
- HUVR offers a purpose-built platform for industrial inspections in the Energy industry. It includes a web and mobile app that work together to create a feature-rich all-inclusive platform for inspectors to report their work, and companies can keep track of all their inspection data in one place.
- I work across the full stack to design, build, and maintain core features for HUVR’s platform, reporting directly to the CTO.

🏦 I've worked 5 years in the Financial Tech industry
- At [Yobota](https://www.yobota.com) then [Chetwood Financial](https://chetwood.co) we built a bank from the ground up in the cloud. It supported 5 different live financial products in the UK market, and 3 financial institutions on the platform. I joined as the 20th employee in 2018, and left a 300-person company in 2023.
- I was responsible for the third-party integrations and quantitative functions (~11 people). This involved multiple core parts of the banking platform, including handling credit checks, loan payments, transfers and card payments, savings account transactions, interest rate calculation and adjustment, and more.
