🇺🇸 I'm a software developer currently working for [HUVRdata](https://www.huvrdata.com/) in Austin, Texas.
- We're building a simple, purpose-built platform for industrial inspections.

🏦 I've worked 5 years in the Financial Tech industry
- At [Yobota](https://www.yobota.com) then [Chetwood Financial](https://chetwood.co) we built a bank from the ground up in the cloud. It supported 5 different live financial products in the UK market, and 3 financial institutions on the platform. I joined as the 20th employee in 2018, and left a 300-person company in 2023.
- I was responsible for the third-party integrations and quantitative functions (~11 people). This involved multiple core parts of the banking platform, including handling credit checks, loan payments, transfers and card payments, savings account transactions, interest rate calculation and adjustment, and more.
